# Project-2

Part 1:
The Program asks user for the intial account balance.
It asks the user for monthly deposit amount.
It asks the user for the annual interest rate.
Finally the program askes the user to enter the number of years the user wishes to calculate for.
Part 2:
This project calculates a bank or investment account balance based on an initial account balance.
The program then calculates that annual account balance based on a non-compounding annual interest and displays the closing year account balance.
Part 3:
This project calculates a bank or investment account balance based on an initial acccount balance and a monthly deposit. 
This project then calculates a new annual account balance based on this monthly deposit and a user specified interest rate.
The interest rate is calculated with a compounding interest rate.

I feel that my code is written in a manner that is easily readable, and organized for future edits to the program. 
My inline comments are well thought out, and describe well what each section compiles or achieves.

I'm sure that I could enhance this code in a few different places. 
I think that perhaps I created and initialized variables globally, that may have been better served as local variables with pointers. 

The biggest challange that I faced was getting the calculation for compounding interest to calculate correctly and read user input correctly.
I struggled the most with this because of my unfarmiliarity with pointers at the time of writing the program. 
To overcome this, I frevisited the text, and used the internet a lot.
Most of those recources were a dead end, and in the end I simply took what I had read from many different sources and began to clean up my code, and just play with it.
Through this, I was able to better understand how pointers work, and how to use them more effectively. 

I'm sure that all the practice and additional learning that I have done in this project willl come in handy in the future.
Learning how to write cleaner code, and how better to structure my code as well as variable definition and initialization will come in handy.
I also learned a lot about using multiple files and the organization benefits of such uses.

I think the program is very readeable due to the inline comments.
It's adaptable because I didn't force any part of the code into the main function.
Every section of this code is written within it's own function. so adding additional functions would be simpler. 
The menu function of the code is wrapped in a while loop, so adding additional commands is simple and ready.
